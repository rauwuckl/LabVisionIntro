# Lab Vision Model Starter Pack
## Installation

Download the repository and spike. In the shell:   
`git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/rauwuckl/LabVisionIntro.git`  

Compile it:  
Switch into Build directory
`cd /LabVisionIntro/Spike/Build`

Now compile with   
`cmake ..; make -j8`  

## Running the model:


Stuff changed so now it can be run for example like:  
`./Model -n white_diamond_l_vs_r_new_inh -s ../expSpecs/white_diamond_left_vs_right.json -b 40 -q 80 -e 200 -t 1 -p ../netParams/ALS_more_syn_new_inh.json`  

-n foldername  
-s json file containing the training and testing list and net parameters   
-b start with epoch 40   
-q stop learning rate increasement at epoch 80   
-e train for 200 epochs   
-t test every epoch    
-p overwrite parameters with this file (has to come after -s to overwrite those params)   


## Spike Version
The version of Spike included is located at github.com/rauwuckl/Spike.   
It is a fork of the branch `nasfix` in github.com/OFTNAI/Spike. I added some details but it should still largely be compatible.
